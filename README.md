# Operating System

Hello, I am here to study MIT's xv6 OS from https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2024/index.html, so most of the credits and code goes to them.

I will copy some of the xv6-rsicv OS (https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) code pieces by pieces from scratch to see how a basic OS works. Hopefully you would like to see how I am learning it.

[potential updates of this file will be added to this line,...]

I was hoping this repository can also help other people who wanted to learn OS but feel intimidated by the complicated code to feel it is not scary. Not sure how long it will take me to do this, but got to start somewhere. Good Luck to me!
